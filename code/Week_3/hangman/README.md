Hangman, by Ivan Garcia and Roman Johnson

A one or two player game using the random-word generator gem.
Hangman is a traditional game in which a player chooses letters of the alphabet to guess a pre-chosen word.

Each letter is used only once. Correct guesses are rewarded by revealing all instances of that letter. Incorrect choices are punished by drawing a body part on a hangman's gallows. The color of the ascii-gallows changes as a warning from green, to yellow, to red.When the full body is represented, the player has lost and the word is revealed.

In one player mode, a word is randomly generated by the random-word gem. In two player mode, each player inputs the word for game. Word input is obscured via "*****" - asterisks.

Player names are stored and persisted via local text file. A leaderboard is maintained, including all users. Player leaderboard stats are ranked primarily by number of wins, secondarily by number of losses.

Choice of difficulty level modifies the number of false guesses allowed, not word selection, fewer guesses being more difficult.
